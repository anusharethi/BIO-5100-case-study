Could you give me the R code to plot BCA assay data. The protein standard concentrations are 0, 0.025, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2. The absorbance of the protein standards are 0, 0.004, 0.028, 0.058, 0.118, 0.215, 0.294, 0.418. The unknown protein names are Male control, Female control, Male dosed, and Female dosed. The absorbance values of the unknown proteins are 0.1712, 0.1865, 0.237, 0.2345, respectively.

Sure, here's a simple R code to plot the BCA assay data using ggplot2:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Define data
protein_standards <- data.frame(
  Concentration = c(0, 0.025, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2),
  Absorbance = c(0, 0.004, 0.028, 0.058, 0.118, 0.215, 0.294, 0.418),
  Type = rep("Standard", 8)
)

unknown_proteins <- data.frame(
  Protein = c("Male control", "Female control", "Male dosed", "Female dosed"),
  Absorbance = c(0.1712, 0.1865, 0.237, 0.2345),
  Type = rep("Unknown", 4)
)

all_data <- rbind(protein_standards, unknown_proteins)

# Plot
ggplot(all_data, aes(x = Concentration, y = Absorbance, color = Type, shape = Type)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(16, 17)) +
  labs(x = "Concentration (mg/ml)", y = "Absorbance", title = "BCA Assay Data") +
  theme_minimal()


This code creates a scatter plot with concentration on the x-axis and absorbance on the y-axis. Protein standards are represented by blue circles, while unknown proteins are represented by red triangles.

I see, let's simplify the plot and ensure that the data is structured correctly:

I see the issue now. It seems I mistakenly attempted to bind the data frames protein_standards and unknown_proteins, which have different structures. Let's correct this by creating a single data frame that includes all the necessary information:

The error indicates that the x-axis scale is being treated as continuous, but it contains discrete values. This likely occurs because the "Concentration" variable is being treated as numeric, but it should be treated as a factor since it represents categories rather than continuous values.

Let's modify the code to treat "Concentration" as a factor:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

protein_standards <- data.frame(
  Concentration = c(0, 0.025, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2),

  Type = rep("Standard", 8),
  Protein = NA
)

unknown_proteins <- data.frame(
  Concentration = factor(NA),
  Absorbance = c(0.1712, 0.1865, 0.237, 0.2345),
  Type = rep("Unknown", 4),
  Protein = c("Male control", "Female control", "Male dosed", "Female dosed")
)

all_data <- rbind(protein_standards, unknown_proteins)

# Fit linear model to standard data
lm_model <- lm(Absorbance ~ Concentration, data = protein_standards)

It seems the error persists, likely because the unknown proteins' concentrations are set to NA, causing the x-axis scale to be treated as continuous. To fix this, we need to assign proper concentrations to the unknown proteins. Since you want to mark the unknown protein names at their specific x-axis and y-axis values, you'll need to specify the concentrations for each unknown protein.

Let's update the code to include proper concentrations for the unknown proteins:

R

# Load necessary libraries

  Type = rep("Standard", 8),
  Protein = NA
)

unknown_proteins <- data.frame(
  Concentration = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4),  # Assigning concentrations for unknown proteins
  Absorbance = c(0.1712, 0.1865, 0.237, 0.2345),
  Type = rep("Unknown", 4),
  Protein = c("Male control", "Female control", "Male dosed", "Female dosed")
)

# Fit linear model to standard data
lm_model <- lm(Absorbance ~ Concentration, data = protein_standards)

# Plot

In this updated code, I assigned concentrations for each unknown protein, and then I plotted the data accordingly. This should resolve the issue. Adjust the concentrations as needed based on your actual data.

It seems the error persists despite assigning concentrations for the unknown proteins. Let's revise the approach by combining both the standard and unknown protein data frames and then plotting them together:

You're correct; my apologies for the oversight. Let's calculate the concentrations of the unknown proteins based on their absorbance values relative to the standard curve. We'll use linear interpolation to estimate the concentrations. Here's how we can do it:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Define standard curve data
standard_curve <- data.frame(
  Concentration = c(0, 0.025, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2),
  Absorbance = c(0, 0.004, 0.028, 0.058, 0.118, 0.215, 0.294, 0.418)
)

# Define absorbance values of unknown proteins
unknown_absorbance <- c(0.1712, 0.1865, 0.237, 0.2345)

# Interpolate concentrations for unknown proteins
unknown_concentrations <- approx(standard_curve$Absorbance, standard_curve$Concentration, xout = unknown_absorbance)$y

# Create dataframe for unknown proteins with calculated concentrations
unknown_proteins <- data.frame(
  Concentration = unknown_concentrations,
  Absorbance = unknown_absorbance,
  Type = rep("Unknown", length(unknown_absorbance)),
  Protein = c("Male control", "Female control", "Male dosed", "Female dosed")
)

# Combine data frames
all_data <- rbind(standard_curve, unknown_proteins)

# Fit linear model to standard data
lm_model <- lm(Absorbance ~ Concentration, data = standard_curve)

# Plot
p <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = Concentration, y = Absorbance, color = Type, shape = Type)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(data = standard_curve, method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(data = unknown_proteins, aes(label = Protein), hjust = -0.5, vjust = 0.5, size = 3) +

In this code:

We calculate the concentrations of the unknown proteins using linear interpolation based on their absorbance values relative to the standard curve.
Then, we create a dataframe unknown_proteins with the calculated concentrations, absorbance values, and other necessary information.
Finally, we plot the combined data (standard curve and unknown proteins) and fit a linear model to the standard curve data.

In this code:

We use scale_color_manual() with a custom legend to specify both the standard and unknown data colors and override the shapes.
We set guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = NA)) to remove the shapes from the legend.
We customize the legend text color using legend.text = element_text(color = c("black", unknown_colors)) to match the protein name colors.
We adjust legend.spacing.y to increase the spacing between legend items for better readability.

My apologies for the oversight. Let's ensure that the protein names are color-coded in the legend. We'll create a custom legend by combining the protein names and their respective colors. Here's the corrected code:

In this code:

To ensure that the colors of the unknown data points are included in the legend, we need to specify the fill aesthetic within the aes() function for the geom_point() layer that plots the unknown data points. Let's make this adjustment in the code:

lm_model <- lm(Absorbance ~ Concentration, data = standard_curve)

# Define colors for unknown proteins
unknown_colors <- c("Male control" = "blue", "Female control" = "red", "Male dosed" = "green", "Female dosed" = "purple")

In this updated code, we added aes(fill = Protein) within the geom_point() layer that plots the unknown data points, ensuring that the protein names are color-coded. Then, we provided the appropriate fill aesthetic mapping in the scale_fill_manual() function for the custom legend.

Sure, to ensure that the data points in the plot also have the correct colors, we can use the color aesthetic in geom_point() for both the standard and unknown data points. Let's update the code accordingly:

In this updated code:

We added aes(color = "Standard") in geom_point() to color the standard data points.
We modified geom_point() for the unknown data points to include aes(color = Protein), ensuring that the points are color-coded by protein type.
We set fill = "white" in geom_point() for the unknown data points to ensure that the points are outlined with the color but filled with white.

Now, both the standard and unknown data points are correctly colored, and the legend includes the appropriate color mapping for the protein names.
